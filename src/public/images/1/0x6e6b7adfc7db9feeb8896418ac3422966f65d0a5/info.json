  "reason": "NET is [Nektar Network](https://nektar.network/)\u2019s native ERC-20 token on Ethereum, which just had it's TGE and [airdrop](https://medium.com/@nektarnetwork/claim-your-net-tokens-a-guide-to-nektars-community-distribution-3b02aba919eb). \r\n\r\nThe token is verified on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nektar-network).\r\n\r\nTransferability will be enabled on Dec 3th, at 12pm UTC. Due to the airdrop to over 50,000 addresses in the broader Ethereum community, a decent amount of trading volume is expected. In preparation of this, a [Balancer pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x6e6b7adfc7db9feeb8896418ac3422966f65d0a5) for this token has been created on Ethereum mainnet. It will be incentivized and managed by the team behind Paladin ([Mithras Labs](https://x.com/mithras_labs)). We also expect some Uniswap v3 pools to pop up, so it would be great if we can point users to Cowswap to get the best rates. \r\n\r\nNote: liquidity will only be added on Dec 3th around 12pm UTC. That's the time the token becomes transferable.\r\n\r\n**We already had requests in our community to add the token to Cowswap, because they want to use Cowswap limit orders.**\r\n\r\nLearn more: \r\n- https://docs.nektar.network/token\r\n\r\n",
