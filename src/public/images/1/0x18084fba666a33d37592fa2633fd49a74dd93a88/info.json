It's the successor of tBTC v1, which dramatically increases scalability through capital efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe want to minimize the chance for confusion for your users.\r\n\r\nAdding 'deprecated' to the tBTC v1 token listings, will reduce the chance of someone attempting to acquire tBTC v2 to acquire tBTC v1\r\n\r\nAdding tBTC v2 as a new listing, with the correct logo, will increase the chance that someone that attempts to acquire tBTC v2 will select the correct asset.",
