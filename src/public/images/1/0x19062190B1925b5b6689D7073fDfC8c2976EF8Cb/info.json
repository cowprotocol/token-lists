  "reason": "The BZZ token provides users with access to data relay and storage services, and compensates node operators for these services.\r\n\r\nIt is the native token that powers Swarm, a peer-to-peer network of nodes that collectively provide a decentralised storage and communication service. This system is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which is enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/swarm#markets\r\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-swarm/markets/\r\nhttps://tokens.kleros.io/token/0xe6747460d9316d7689ad3916ec72ab3cdaef24bcf3512b247b1ebd1026c4220f\r\n\r\nSeveral audits from Quantstamp, Least Authority and Cure53 were performed before launch.
