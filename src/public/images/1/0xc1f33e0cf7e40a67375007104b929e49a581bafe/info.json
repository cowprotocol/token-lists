  "reason": "SPOT is a decentralized flatcoin that uses tranching instead of liquidation markets to provide stability that scales. SPOT can be held directly as a refuge from inflation, used as a peer-to-peer digital cash, or held as alternative collateral to USDC within reserves.\n\nIt was created by the Ampleforth team and supported by industry players including Pantera, Coinbase Ventures, and advised by fellows at the Stanford Hoover Institution.\n\nThere are already relayers doing specialized routing to SPOT endpoints, but we recently realized that the SPOT token itself does not exist in any Cowswap token lists.",
