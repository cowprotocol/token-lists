  "reason": "RLP (Resolv Liquidity Pool) absorbs these risks and ensures  stablecoin keeps the peg even in the most adverse conditions. If any losses occur, they are attributed to RLP holders only.\n\nIn exchange for providing that protection, RLP holders receive delta-neutral yield with self-balancing leverage (a thinner RLP layer leads to higher leverage, and vice versa). Higher risk - higher returns.\n\nRisk takers should understand the exposure at all times, that\u2019s why we are fully transparent, [check our collateral pool.](https://app.resolv.xyz/collateral-pool)\n\nhttps://resolv.xyz/rlp",
