  "reason": "Swell is an LST which is sitting just under 37 million in TVL. We entered the space roughly a month ago and are looking to help diversify the current offering of LSTs. We have roughly 19-20 Million of Liquidity across Balancer, Maverick and Univ3 so that shouldn't be an issue. We are really interested in what Cowswap is doing from a meta-aggregator perspective and getting on the token list would help use better recommend Cowswap to our users.",
