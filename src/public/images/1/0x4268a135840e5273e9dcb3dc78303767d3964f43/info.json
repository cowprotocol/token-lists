  "reason": "The  Protocol facilitates a permissionless, exchange-traded fund (ETF) mechanism for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It operates through a vault system where NFTs are deposited and a corresponding  token is minted, representing the value of the NFTs within the vault. The  token can be traded in the open market, and its value is pegged to the collective floor prices of the NFTs in the vault, as determined by an external oracle.\r\n\r\nFungify has a proven track record of success. The first product, a lending protocol, has been live for over seven months and has generated more than 0 million in loan volume, demonstrating strong market demand and user engagement. The second product, The Index, is positioned to capitalize on this success, with the DEX pool already seeded with 00,000 in liquidity.\r\n\r\nMore information in the docs on docs.fungify.it.",
