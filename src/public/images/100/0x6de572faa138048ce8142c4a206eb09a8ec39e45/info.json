  "reason": "The idea behind Circles is that people can create and use their own money. We are now adding a very important piece to to it: groups/communities. In addition to the pure p2p layer of Circles we are adding \u201cgroup currencies\u201d. As a first experiment we are launching the \u201cHumans of Gnosis\u201d group. As a big milestone we want to allow anyone to buy a DappCon ticket this year with \u201cHoG\u201d (Human of Gnosis) tokens. \r\nSome people won't be able to mint enough HoG thus we would like them to purchase them via Cowswap.\r\nWe will provide liquidity for the token once we open the ticket sale.
